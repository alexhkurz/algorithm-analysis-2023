# Projects

The projects are coming to an end. There have been a number of assignments during the semester on Canvas. Here are some hints for your final submission and the presentation.

## The Repository (46 points)

- The project must be open source and on a public git repository.
- The repository is structured in a way that makes it as easy as possible for a reader to access the relevant information. This includes proper use of markdown syntax.
- There should be an introduction motivating the project and explaining why it is interesting (a good project has a convincing narrative).
- There should be a literature review, references to related work and theoretical background (a good project describes the wider context in which it is situated).
- The readme must contain a description of how to deploy and run the software.
- The code must run, be well commented and documented.
- The documentation should include, for example (adapt as appropriate):
    - What components does the software consist of? How do components interact?
    - What programming languages and APIs are used?
    - What data structures and algorithms did you implement?
    - How was the work divided between group members? Who was responsible for what?
- Give details of how the software was tested. Provide the tests that have been written, as well as a description of how to run the tests and reproduce the test test results. 
- Depending on the project, there may be other ways of validating the software (eg questionnaires, data analysis, and more).
- Describe what works and what does not. Did your plans change? What is left to do?
- Suggest directions for future development. Ideally, a list of possible extensions is described and designed, including details of how the current code base should be modified for the extension.

The last point is particularly important to me. A good open source project is one that inspires others to take it further and provides a basis for future developments.  

## The Presentation (20 points)

The presentation will take up some of the points already mentioned above, for example:

- There should be an introduction motivating the project and explaining why it is interesting.
- There should be a literature review, references to related work and theoretical background.
- Some details on design, specification and implementation. 
- The role of data structures and algorithms in the project. Describe the algorithms involved in some detail, in particular if you designed and implemented them yourself.
- How was the work divided between group members? Who was responsible for what?
- Some details on results and achievements.
- Directions for future development.
