\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

First you need to \href{https://www.latex-project.org/get/}{download and install} LaTeX.\footnote{Links are typeset in blue, but you can change the layout and color of the links if you locate the  \texttt{hypersetup} command.}
%
For quick experimentation, you can use an online editor such as \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn}{Overleaf}. But to grade the report I will used the time-stamped pdf-files in your git repository.  

 
\medskip\noindent
LaTeX is a markup language (as is, for example, HTML). The source code is in a \verb+.tex+ file and needs to be compiled for viewing, usually to \verb+.pdf+.


\medskip\noindent
If you want to change the default layout, you need to type commands. For example, \verb+\medskip+ inserts a medium vertical space and \verb+\noindent+ starts a paragraph without indentation.
 
\medskip\noindent
Mathematics is typeset between double dollars, for example $$x+y=y+x.$$


\section{LaTeX Resources}

I start a new subsection, so that you can see how it appears in the table of contents.

\subsection{Subsections}

Sometimes it is good to have subsections.

\subsubsection{Itemize and enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item This is how you itemize in LaTeX.
\item I think a good way to learn LaTeX is by starting from this template file and build it up step by step. Often stackoverflow will answer your questions. But here are a few resources:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes}{Learn LaTeX in 30 minutes}
  \item \href{https://www.latex-project.org/}{LaTeX â€“ A document preparation system}\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Typesetting Code}

A typical project will involve code. For the example below I took the LaTeX code from \href{https://stackoverflow.com/a/3175141/4600290}{stackoverflow} and the Haskell code from \href{https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/HylLKujCP}{my tutorial}.

\begin{lstlisting}
-- run the transition function on a word and a state
run :: (State -> Char -> State) -> State -> [Char] -> State
run delta q [] = q
run delta q (c:cs) = run delta (delta q c) cs 
\end{lstlisting}
%
Short snippets such as \texttt{run :: (State -> Char -> State) -> State -> [Char] -> State} can also be directly fitted into text. There are several ways of doing this, for example, \verb@run :: (State -> Char -> State) -> State -> [Char] -> State@ is slightly different in terms of spaces and linebreaking (and can lead to layout that is better avoided), as is
\begin{verbatim}run :: (State -> Char -> State) -> State -> [Char] -> State\end{verbatim}

\noindent
For more on the topic see \href{https://www.overleaf.com/latex/examples/code-presentations-example-different-ways-shown-in-beamer-metropolis/tsxpnyjbhbds}{Code-Presentations Example}.

\medskip\noindent
Generally speaking,  the methods for displaying code discussed above work well only for short listings of code. For entire programs, it is better to have external links to, for example, Github or \href{https://replit.com/@alexhkurz/automata01#main.hs}{Replit} (click on the "Run" button and/or the ``Code" tab).

\subsection{Including Images}

It is not possible to include pipes but it is possible to include images, see for example Figure~\ref{pipe}. If you want to allow the image to float to the top of a page insert it in a figure environment. 

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{cecinestpasunepipe.jpg}
\end{center}
\caption{Magritte's painting ``This is not a pipe"}\label{pipe}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{More Mathematics}

We have already seen $x+y=y+x$ as an example of inline maths. We can also typeset mathematics in display mode, for example
$$\frac x y =\frac{xy}{y^2},$$

\noindent
Here is an example of equational reasoning that spans several lines:
\begin{align*}
{\rm fib}(3)
& = {\rm fib}(1) +{\rm fib}(2)  & {\rm fib}(n+2) = {\rm fib}(n)  + {\rm fib}(n+1) \\
& = {\rm fib}(1) +{\rm fib}(0)  + {\rm fib}(1) & {\rm fib}(n+2) = {\rm fib}(n)  + {\rm fib}(n+1) \\
& = 1 + 0  +1 & {\rm fib}(0) = 0,   {\rm fib}(1) = 1\\
& = 2 & {\rm arithmetic}
\end{align*}

\subsubsection{Definitons, Examples, Theorems, Etc}

\begin{definition} 
This is a definition.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
This is an example.
\end{example}

\begin{proposition}
This is a proposition.
\end{proposition}

\begin{theorem}
This is a theorem.
\end{theorem}

\noindent You can also create your own environment, eg if you want to have Question, Notation, Conjecture, etc.

\section{Plagiarism}

To avoid plagiarism, make sure that in addition to \cite{Alg} you also cite all the external sources you use. Make sure you cite all your references in your text, not only at the end.


\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}

In this document, to help you getting started, I gave a first succinct example of typesetting in Latex.
