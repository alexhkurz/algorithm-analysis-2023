# Feedback for Homework

## Week 2

In class, I went carefully through another example of converting an NFA to a DFA. The NFA was specified by: *All words that start and end with `a` or only consists of `b`.* We used this example to also review the whole process

    specification (language) -> NFA -> DFA -> implementation

I emphasized that one needs to first construct the DFA in table form and then draw it out as a picture.

We also discussed what consists only of `b`s means and revised the logical meaning of "for all" and "implication".
