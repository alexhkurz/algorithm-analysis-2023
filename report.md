# Report

Instead of a midterm and final exam, you will write a report. Think of it as a take home with several deadlines throughout the semester. Out of a total of 200 points the report is divided up as follows.

- (12x4=48 points): Homework.
- (32 points): Paper.
- (10 points): Layout, typesetting.

The report will be written in Latex. A template for your LaTeX source file [`report.tex`](report/report.tex) and the compiled [pdf](report/report.pdf). See also [`latex-example.tex`](report/latex-example.tex) and [`latex-example.pdf`](report/latex-example.pdf).

- You will keep both report.tex and report.pdf in a personal private Github repository. 
- In your repo, make a subdirectory `src` where you store the program files  (if a homework requires programming). 
- Always use the same repository for all submissions of the course (get in touch if you want to make an exception).
- Do not name different versions of your report, instead rely on the version control of git.
- Give me access to your private github repo by inviting me as a collaborator (my GitHub name is alexhkurz).
- Submission info below.

## Homework

**Deadlines:**
- Weekly deadlines. Each week has 2 points upon completion.  The remaining points are awarded after the final deadline at the end of final examination week. You are expected to improve upon your weekly submissions for the final version of the report.
- Deadline is the Sunday at midnight. This gives me time to look over your answers on Monday. I will discuss the questions Tuesday in class and you will have an opportunity to improve your answers. 
- The full report is due on the Sunday following the Saturday of final examination week. 

**Submission:**  After completing the homework, each weak, **submit the URL of your github repo** (containing report.tex and report.pdf) **via Canvas** before the deadline. Make sure that you share access to your private repo with me.

Let me say again: Do not keep different copies of your report in the repo. I will use git to verify timestamps and git's version control if I need to go back to an earlier version.
