L1: [Outline of the course](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/BkmoBQUui) and [List of Projects](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/B1BVO6Bjj)

L2-4: As a scaffolding for the lectures on DFAs and NFAs I use my notes entitled [A Short Introduction to Automata](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/HylLKujCP). These notes are not self-contained so attending the lectures is essential. If anything is unclear ask questions in class or office hours.
