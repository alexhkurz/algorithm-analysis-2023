# Lecture by lecture

## Introduction

- L 1.1: [Outline of the course](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/BkmoBQUui) and [List of Projects](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/B1BVO6Bjj)

## DFAs and NFAs

- L1.2, 2.1, 2.2: As a scaffolding for the lectures on DFAs and NFAs I use my notes entitled [A Short Introduction to Automata](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/HylLKujCP). These notes are not self-contained so attending the lectures is essential. If anything is unclear ask questions in class or office hours. Assignment available on Canvas.

## Knowledge Representation and Logic Programming

I believe my notes linked below explain all the technicalities you need to know, but for motivation, background and general information you need to come to the lectures. The assignment is pen-and-paper, but for the full experience I recommend to [download and install](https://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable) Prolog. You can follow along and run [the example programs](https://github.com/alexhkurz/algorithm-analysis-2023/tree/main/logic-programming/src) I use in class. 

- L 3.1: [Introduction to Logic Programming](https://github.com/alexhkurz/algorithm-analysis-2023/blob/main/logic-programming/slides/LP1-introduction-to-logic-programming.pdf) ...
