# Model Checking with Spin - Tutorial 1 (Mutual Exclusion)

<b>We start this tutorial with programs that are easy, so that we can learn the behaviour of the tool on simple examples 
([mutex.try1.pml](src/mutex.try1.pml), [mutex.try2.pml](src/mutex.try2.pml)). 
Here it is important to understand that we can use SPIN in simulation mode and in verification mode (see below).
We finish the tutorial with two examples that are less simple, namely <a href="src/mutex.peterson-a.pml">mutex.peterson-a.pml</a> and 
<a href="src/mutex.peterson-b.pml">mutex.peterson-b.pml</a>. They look almost the same, but are they both correct? </b>
