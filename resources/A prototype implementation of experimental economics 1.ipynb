    "# A prototype implementation of experimental economics, part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "by Gabriele Camera, Alexander Kurz, David Rojo Arjona\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction:** This program presents a prototype of a software that can be used to run experiments in behavioural economics. Ultimately, there will be a client-server architecture with the server running the \"economics engine\" implemented below and participants of the experiment (subjects) providing decisions (actions) and extensions of the setting described will be investigated. Here only a simple economics engine is implemented. Subjects are simulated by functions that choose random actions. The cell at the end of this notebook contains code that runs a simulated experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To run this notebook** one can follow items 1 and 2 at [JuliaTutorials](https://github.com/JuliaAcademy/JuliaTutorials/blob/main/README.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background:** At each point in time, ***agents*** are matched pairwise, one being the ***producer***, the other the ***consumer***. Each producer chooses an ***action*** which can be thought of as providing ***consumption*** goods to the other agents in the group. Agents recieve ***utility*** (aka ***payoff***) from consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Naming conventions in the program:** \"define\" refers to parameters that the experimenter will adjust, \"make\" refers to data generated by the software, \"choose\" refers to input that will come from the participants of the experiement\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters that remain fixed throughout the dynamic evolution of the economy are:"
